## The `{{route-metadata-scroll}}` helper

This addon provides a simple class helper that listens for events fired by the RouteMetadata service and scrolls the 
page accordingly. 

To add scrolling to an application...

* Call the helper once from the application.hbs template.
* Add a scroll key to the metadata of any route segment that requires scrolling on entry.
